CS171 Chatbot about Covid-19 around Irvine
This chatbot uses CYK-algorithm to parse sentences from users, which is support coded by Professor Dan Frost from CS171

I used libraries datetime and requests, you may need to use pip to install
them if they are not installed. To run from the command line, I use py
"C:\Users\Lanxiang Yang\source\repos\CS171 Project Part 3\CS171 Project Part
3\chatbot.py" , where the latter part is the full path of chatbot.py file. Be careful with the
path you are running with, errors would occur if the current path does not have the
dependencies libraries installed. I have to run from Anaconda Prompt or activate the
conda environment first in CMD.
